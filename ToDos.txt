- Rerun GLM for new contrasts
- Rerun ROI timeseries extraction
    - add try...catch with log of failures
- DCM decide whether:
    - 2-3 different models, estimate params for each subject
    - many different models, estimate params for each subject (think less, compute more :))
- DCM specs first attempts:
    - driving inputs at MPFC or PREC or both (because Jakob said so :))
    - intrinsic connections: fully connected, maybe remove some and see what happens (surely try to remove the one from TOM paper)
    - modulatory connections: first everywhere, possibly try to remove those going to driving input regions
- DCM write script which can alter DCM params
    - intrinsic and modulatory connectivity matrices, input matrices (where driving input is applied)
